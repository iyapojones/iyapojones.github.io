         <p>Spider-Man is the quintessential Marvel character. Although a super
           hero, he is spared none of the slings and arrows of ordinary life; he
           experiences difficulties with friends, family, sweethearts and employers.
           His powers enable him to do good, but not to improve his own lot in life,
           and it is his simple humanity, rather than his exotic talent, that has
           won him millions of enthusiastic fans. He is one super-hero who has not
           lost the common touch, and in fact he is frequently described as "your
           friendly neighborhood Spider-Man." </p>

          <p>In his 1962 debut, Spider-Man took to fighting crime for a reason
            commonplace in comc books: he was motivated by the murder of a father
            figure, his Uncle Ben. Yet Spidey's driving force is guilt, not revenge;
            he must live forever with the knowledge that he could have prevented
            the killing if he had not been so self absorbed. Perhaps he suffers
            from a classic Oedipus complex; in any case he is certainly neurotic,
            forever agonizing over the choices that confront him when he attempts
            to do the right thing. Despite his best efforts, he is viewed with a
            touch of suspicion by those in authority, and is sometimes considered
            little more than a criminal himself. </p>

          <p>Although nobody seems to understand him, Spider-Man has the spirit
            to be a joker as well as a tragic figure. He is quick with a quip,
            appreciates the irony of his endless predicaments, and relishes the
            chance to play tricks on people who never suspect that he and Peter
            Parker are one and the same.</p>

          <p>As originally depicted by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko,
            Peter Parker was just a bit of a wimp. Bright, imaginative, but
            nonetheless an alienated adolescent, he might well have been a typical
            comic book reader. Although he has matured and gained in confidence
            over the years. Spidey is still all to human. He misses appointments,
            catches the flu when he needs to fight, forgets to put film in his
            camera and has trouble paying the rent. In short Spider-Man remains
            Everyman, "the super hero who could be you."</p>

            <h2>Powers</h2>

            <p>Spider-Sense - 6th sense, a tingling sensation, that lets Peter
              know about impending danger and about his environment to a degree.</p>

            <p>Adhesive Grip for climbing walls and ceilings; Can cling to any surface
            and includes being able to run up buildings and walls.Though Spider-Man
            tends to focus on his hands and his feet whenever
            he is climbing up a wall, every part of his body has the same clinging
            ability. His back and head can stick to surfaces as easily as his fingers
            and toes. All he has to do is lean against something and he will stick
            to it until he decides to free himself.</p>

            <p>Enhanced Intelligence - ability to creat gadget and perform chemistry</p>

            <p>Enhanced Agility and spider-like reflexes. He leaps from rooftops,
            summersaults over flagpoles, tumbles off water towers, and balances
            on top of light poles as he routinely travels across the city in his
            own unique manner. Spider-Man's reflexes operate up to forty times
            faster than those of a normal person</p>

            <p>Enhanced Speed</p>

            <p>Spider-sense strong enough to let Spiderman reflexively dodge without
              thinking often enough to come up with quips and jokes almost constantly
               to get under the skin of his enemies</p>

            <p>Super Strength - able to life almost 10 tons; can bend a solid iron
              bar with bare hands and shatter a concrete wall with a single punch.
              Can leap the height of 3 stories of the width of a highway.</p>

            <p>Web-Slinging he produced an adhesive fluid capable of imitating a spider's silk webbing.
              TO complete the mechanism, Peter then designed and built a pair of
              web-shooters that snapped on his wrists.
              He now switches between different forms of webbing by the way he taps his trigger. With a short
               second tap he releases a thin cable like strand that is perfect for
                web-swinging. A longer second tap increases the strand's thickness for
                 additional support. If Spiey prolongs the pressure on the fluid,
                 web fluid squirts out in the form of an adhesive liquid which can
                 paste a foe against a wall. A series of brisk taps discharges many
                 thin strands that form a fine spray of webbing, perfect for blinding
                  an opponent. The pressure in Spider-Man's web-cartridges is enough to propel a single
               strand of webbing up to 50 yards, but thicker strands and more complex
               web patterns can't reach nearly as far. Each of his web-shooters has
                ten cartridges, and each cartridge contains approximately 1,000 yards
                 of single-strand webbing. [The] web begins to harden the instant it
                 is exposed to air. Given enough time and sufficient thickness, one
                 strand could even bind the incredible Hulk and hold him prisoner -
                  although it's hard to imagine the Hulk standing still while Spidey
                  applies the necessary webbing!</p>

              <p>Spidey's normal webbing can easily withstand temperaturs of 1,000 degrees
               Farenheit. It melts, but it has never caught on fire. If the wall-crawler
                is preparing to fight someone like the Human TOrch, he can pack a webbing
                 which resists temperatures of up to 10,000 degrees Farenheit. This type
                  can only be released in strands that are as thick as a clothesline.
                  Its special cartridge can only hold 10 yards of the webbing at a time.</p>

            <h2>Devotion</h2>

            <p>
               The heart can think of no devotion<br />
               Greater than being shore to the ocean&mdash;<br />
               Holding the curve of one position,<br />
               Counting an endless repetition.
